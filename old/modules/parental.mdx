# Module: Parental Controls

**The Parental Controls module provides a framework for guardians to manage the digital environment of their wards (e.g., children). It allows for the creation of fine-grained, machine-readable rules that govern a ward's access to content and their ability to interact with others.**

This module leverages the **Open Digital Rights Language (ODRL)** to create flexible and transparent policies, moving beyond simple blocklists to a more nuanced system of digital guardianship.

## Purpose and Functionality

The primary goal of the `parental` module is to provide powerful and easy-to-use tools for creating a safe and age-appropriate online experience for children and other dependents, while respecting privacy as much as possible.

**Core Functions:**
-   **Guardian/Ward Accounts:** Establishes a cryptographic link between a guardian's WebID and a ward's WebID, allowing the guardian to manage policies for the ward's account.
-   **Policy-Based Rules:** Instead of simple on/off switches, all restrictions are defined as ODRL policies. This allows for complex and context-aware rules.
-   **Content Filtering:** Rules can restrict access to content based on metadata, such as age ratings, content tags, or specific keywords.
-   **Interaction Control:** Guardians can define policies that limit who a ward can communicate with via the `chat` module, for example, by creating an "allow list" of approved contacts.
-   **Time-Based Restrictions:** ODRL policies can include time constraints, allowing guardians to set limits on screen time or restrict application usage to certain hours of the day.
-   **Multilingual Rules:** The rules and their descriptions can be defined in any of the platform's supported languages, making them understandable to guardians and wards from different linguistic backgrounds.

## Technical Implementation

-   **Module Path**: `src/modules/parental/index.js`
-   **UI Component**: The interface for creating and managing parental control policies is rendered by `src/components/ParentalControls.js`.
-   **Ontology**: `ontologies/parental-v1.ttl` defines the specific RDF classes and properties for linking guardian and ward accounts. The rules themselves are defined using the standard **ODRL** vocabulary.
-   **Dependencies**:
    -   `services/odrl`: A service that would be responsible for parsing and evaluating ODRL policies.
    -   `modules/access`: The access control module would be the primary enforcement point, checking all actions against the active ODRL policies for the user.
    -   `modules/addressbook`: To select contacts for interaction allow-lists.
    -   `services/solidos`: To store the ODRL policies in a secure location within the guardian's and/or ward's Solid Pod.

### Example Flow: Restricting Chat Access

1.  A guardian, David, wants to ensure his child, Emily, can only chat with pre-approved family members.
2.  He opens the `ParentalControls.js` interface, selects Emily's profile, and chooses to create a new "Interaction Policy."
3.  He creates a policy that defines a `Prohibition` for the `chat` action. He then adds an exception to this prohibition for a specific group of WebIDs (the family members) from his address book.
4.  When David saves the policy, the `parental` module creates a new ODRL policy document in RDF.
5.  This policy is saved to a location in Emily's Solid Pod that only David (the guardian) has write-access to.
6.  Later, when Emily tries to initiate a chat with a new, unapproved contact in her `Chat.js` component, the following happens:
    a. The `chat` module attempts to open a communication channel.
    b. Before proceeding, it calls the `access` module to check for permissions.
    c. The `access` module evaluates the action (`chat`) against all active policies for Emily. It finds the parental control policy, sees that the recipient is not in the "allow list," and therefore the action is prohibited.
    d. The `access` module returns a "denied" response, and the chat module displays a message to Emily explaining that she does not have permission to contact this user.
