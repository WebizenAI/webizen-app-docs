# Platform: Mobile App

The Webizen Mobile App, built with React Native, serves as a secure, on-the-go companion to the user's primary **Desktop Application**. It is designed to provide access to core social and communication features while upholding the platform's principles of data sovereignty and local-first architecture.

## Role and Purpose

The Mobile App is not a standalone client. Its primary purpose is to act as a secure remote interface to the user's own Webizen node running on their desktop. This design choice is critical for security and privacy, as it ensures that the user's data and private keys never need to reside on a third-party server for mobile access.

**Key Functions:**
-   **Secure Messaging:** Access to the decentralized chat module, including support for native SMS/MMS integration on Android.
-   **Call Management:** Handling and recording calls, with verification provided by the ADP/WebID system.
-   **Address Book:** Access to the user's full contact list stored in their Solid Pod.
-   **AI Assistant:** The ability to send queries from the mobile device to be processed by the AI models (including local Ollama models) running on the Desktop Application.
-   **Offline Capabilities:** While the primary mode is connected, the app is designed to support offline access for features like translation and viewing cached data.

## Architecture: Secure Remote Access via Tailscale

The most critical architectural aspect of the Mobile App is its connectivity model. The app does **not** connect directly to the P2P networks (IPFS, GUN.eco). Instead, it establishes a secure, encrypted tunnel to the user's Desktop Application using **Tailscale (WireGuard)**.

1.  **VPN Tunnel:** Both the Desktop Application and the Mobile App must have Tailscale installed and be logged into the same user account. This automatically creates a secure, peer-to-peer mesh network between the devices.
2.  **API Requests:** When the Mobile App needs to fetch data or perform an action (e.g., send a chat message), it makes a standard API call to the user's Desktop App's local server (e.g., `https://desktop-device-name.tailnet-name.ts.net:8080/api/...`).
3.  **Secure Transit:** This request travels through the encrypted WireGuard tunnel provided by Tailscale, ensuring it is completely private and secure from eavesdropping on the public internet.
4.  **Local Processing:** The Desktop Application receives the request, processes it using its full P2P and data management capabilities, and sends the response back through the same secure tunnel.

This architecture allows the Mobile App to be lightweight and secure, offloading all heavy processing and data storage to the user's sovereign desktop node. It provides the convenience of mobile access without compromising on the core principles of decentralization and data ownership.
