# Platform: Desktop Application

The Webizen Desktop Application is the heart and brain of the entire ecosystem. Built with Electron, it is a full-featured, cross-platform application that runs locally on the user's machine, providing the powerful backend services that the Web Extension and Mobile App rely on.

## Role and Purpose

While the Web Extension offers convenience, the Desktop Application provides **sovereignty and power**. It is the component that truly frees the user's data from centralized servers.

**Key Functions:**
-   **Local Server and API Host:** It runs a local HTTPS server that exposes the [Webizen Core API](../api-reference/webizen-api) over a secure WebSocket connection. This allows other parts of the ecosystem, as well as third-party applications, to interact with the user's data in a controlled and secure manner.
-   **P2P Node:** It acts as a full peer in the decentralized networks, running nodes for IPFS, WebTorrent, and GUN.eco. This enables direct data sharing and real-time communication without intermediaries.
-   **Secure Data Hub:** It manages the user's local **Solid Pod** and the high-speed **Quadstore** cache. All sensitive cryptographic keys are managed exclusively within this application's secure process.
-   **Heavy Lifting:** It handles all computationally intensive tasks, such as processing AI model queries (Ollama), encrypting backups, and signing large data packages.
-   **Application Runtime:** It provides a sandboxed environment for running local Solid and Webizen applications, similar in concept to the historical `cimba` project.

## Architecture: The Local Server

A key feature of the Desktop App is its built-in local server. This server is the foundation for the "local-first" architecture of Webizen.

-   **API Endpoints:** The server hosts the core API endpoints, allowing authenticated clients to perform actions on behalf of the user.
-   **Local App Hosting:** The server provides a runtime environment for sandboxed web applications. A user can "install" a Solid app, and the Desktop Application will serve its files from `localhost`. This allows the app to run locally while still being able to interact with the user's data through the secure Webizen API, which is exposed to its `window` object. This architecture provides a powerful way to run decentralized applications in a secure, sandboxed environment, with the user always in control of data access permissions.

By running these core services locally, the Desktop Application ensures that the user maintains ultimate control and ownership over their data and their digital identity.
