# ODRL: Defining Rights and Policies

A key challenge in any data sharing system, especially a decentralized one, is managing permissions. Who is allowed to do what with a given piece of content? How can we define these rules in a way that is both clear to humans and understandable by machines?

Webizen solves this by using the **Open Digital Rights Language (ODRL)**, a W3C standard for expressing policies, licenses, and agreements. ODRL provides a flexible vocabulary for defining who can perform what actions on a given asset, under what conditions.

## The Role of ODRL in Webizen

In Webizen, ODRL is the foundation for creating clear, enforceable policies for all types of content and interactions.

- **Access Control:** ODRL policies define who can `read`, `write`, or `share` a resource. This is used for everything from controlling access to a private photo album to managing permissions in a collaborative project.
- **Monetization:** ODRL can express commercial terms. For example, a policy can state that the action `play` is permitted for a video file, but only after the `pay` action has been completed with a specific eCash amount.
- **Obligations & Duties:** Policies aren't just about permissions; they can also define obligations. For example, a license for a piece of software might grant the `use` permission, but with the duty to provide `attribution` to the original author.
- **Parental Controls:** The parental controls module uses ODRL to define rules for ward accounts, such as prohibiting access to content with a certain rating or limiting chat interactions to a specific set of approved contacts.

## The Structure of an ODRL Policy

An ODRL policy is structured around a few core concepts, which are expressed as RDF triples.

- **Policy:** The container for a set of rules.
- **Permission:** A rule that allows an action.
- **Prohibition:** A rule that prevents an action.
- **Duty:** An obligation that must be fulfilled in conjunction with a permission.
- **Asset:** The digital resource the policy applies to (e.g., a video, a document).
- **Action:** The specific activity being governed (e.g., `play`, `copy`, `print`).
- **Assigner & Assignee:** The parties involved (who is granting the permission and who is receiving it).
- **Constraint:** A condition that must be met for the rule to apply (e.g., a time limit, a payment amount).

### A Practical Example: Paid Media Access

Let's expand on the example from the previous section. A creator wants to sell access to a high-resolution photograph contained within a `Hypermedia Content Package`. The ODRL policy within that package might look like this (in simplified Turtle syntax):

```turtle
@prefix odrl: [http://www.w3.org/ns/odrl/2/](http://www.w3.org/ns/odrl/2/) .
@prefix ex: [http://example.org/](http://example.org/) .

ex:photo_policy a odrl:Offer ;
    odrl:target ex:high_res_photo.jpg ;
    odrl:assigner [https://creator.example.com/profile#me](https://creator.example.com/profile#me) ;
    
    # Define the permission to view the photo
    odrl:permission [
        a odrl:Permission ;
        odrl:assignee [https://viewer.example.com/profile#me](https://viewer.example.com/profile#me) ;
        odrl:action odrl:display ;
        
        # Add a constraint: this permission is only valid after payment
        odrl:constraint [
            a odrl:Constraint ;
            odrl:leftOperand ex:paymentStatus ;
            odrl:operator odrl:eq ;
            odrl:rightOperand "Paid" .
        ]
    ] ;

    # Define the payment duty
    odrl:duty [
        a odrl:Duty ;
        odrl:action odrl:pay ;
        odrl:constraint [
            a odrl:Constraint ;
            odrl:leftOperand odrl:payAmount ;
            odrl:operator odrl:eq ;
            odrl:rightOperand "1000.00"^^xsd:decimal ;
            odrl:unit [https://e.cash](https://e.cash) .
        ]
    ] .
