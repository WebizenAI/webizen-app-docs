# **Webizen: A Human-Centric, Decentralized Web OS**

**Webizen is a humanitarian-focused, open-source initiative to build a decentralized operating system for the web. Our mission is to empower individuals with true data ownership, privacy, and control over their digital lives.**

This repository contains the source code for the Webizen platform, a proof-of-concept that includes a Web Extension, a powerful Desktop Application, and a Mobile App.

## **üöÄ The Vision**

The modern web is controlled by a handful of centralized platforms. Webizen challenges this paradigm by building an ecosystem on decentralized technologies like Solid, IPFS, and eCash. We are creating a web where:

* **You Own Your Data:** Your identity and data are stored in a personal **Solid Pod** that you control.  
* **Identity is Sovereign:** Your digital identity is managed by you through **WebID**, not by a corporation.  
* **Communication is Private & Secure:** We use P2P protocols and strong, post-quantum-ready cryptography to protect your interactions.  
* **The Platform is Open & Extensible:** Anyone can build and share new features through our modular architecture.
