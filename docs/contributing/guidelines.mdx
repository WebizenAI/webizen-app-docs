# Contribution Guidelines

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Webizen! We are building a community dedicated to creating a more decentralized, private, and human-centric web, and we welcome contributions of all kinds.

This document provides a set of guidelines for contributing to the project to ensure a smooth and effective collaboration process.

## How Can I Contribute?

There are many ways to contribute to the Webizen project, and not all of them involve writing code.

-   **Reporting Bugs:** If you find a bug, please open a detailed issue on our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/WebizenAI/webizen-dev/issues). Include steps to reproduce the bug, what you expected to happen, and what actually happened.
-   **Suggesting Enhancements:** Have an idea for a new feature or an improvement to an existing one? We'd love to hear it. Open an issue and describe your idea in as much detail as possible.
-   **Writing Documentation:** Good documentation is crucial. If you find gaps in our docs, see areas for improvement, or want to write a new guide, please open a pull request.
-   **Submitting Translations:** Webizen aims to be a global platform. You can help by contributing translations for our 15+ supported languages via the **Community** module within the application.
-   **Writing Code:** If you're a developer, you can help by picking up an existing issue, fixing a bug, or building a new feature.

## Your First Code Contribution

If you're ready to contribute code, here is the basic workflow:

1.  **Find an Issue:** Look for issues tagged with `good first issue` or `help wanted` on our GitHub repository. These are great places to start.
2.  **Fork the Repository:** Create your own fork of the `webizen-dev` repository on GitHub.
3.  **Create a Branch:** Create a new branch in your fork for your changes. Please use a descriptive name (e.g., `fix-login-button-bug` or `feature-new-module-xyz`).
    ```bash
    git checkout -b your-branch-name
    ```
4.  **Make Your Changes:** Write your code, ensuring you follow the project's coding standards (see below).
5.  **Test Your Changes:** Run the relevant tests from the **Test Suite** module within the application to ensure your changes haven't introduced any regressions.
6.  **Commit Your Changes:** Write a clear and concise commit message. We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification.
    ```bash
    git commit -m "feat: Add new greeting option to publisher module"
    ```
7.  **Push to Your Fork:**
    ```bash
    git push origin your-branch-name
    ```
8.  **Open a Pull Request:** Go to the main Webizen repository and open a new pull request from your fork. Provide a detailed description of your changes and link to the issue you are addressing.

## Coding Standards

-   **Style:** We use Prettier for automatic code formatting. Please ensure you run it before committing your code.
-   **Linting:** We use ESLint to catch common errors. Please ensure your code has no linting errors.
-   **Comments:** Write clear and concise comments to explain complex or non-obvious parts of your code.

Thank you again for your contribution!
