# Rule-Based Systems: RIF, SWRL, & N3Logic

While SHACL validates the structure of data, Webizen also employs a suite of W3C standards for **rule-based reasoning**. These technologies allow the platform to move beyond simple data storage and validation into the realm of intelligent automation and knowledge inference.

A rule-based system allows us to state "if-then" conditions over our data graph. For example, "IF a `work:Task` is marked as `status:completed` AND it has an associated `work:Contributor`, THEN that contributor `ex:isEligibleForReward`."

Webizen plans to leverage a combination of rule languages to handle different aspects of logic and reasoning.

## The Role of Rules in Webizen

- **Automated Reasoning:** The system can automatically infer new facts from existing data. For example, if "Alice is a friend of Bob" and "Bob is a friend of Carol," a rule could infer that "Alice has an indirect connection to Carol."
- **Enforcing Complex Business Logic:** Rules are perfect for defining and enforcing the complex logic within agreements. An ODRL policy might state a user has the right to access a file, and a RIF rule could enforce the technical outcome of that right.
- **Powering Cognitive AI:** Rules provide a transparent and verifiable logic layer for AI agents. Instead of being a "black box," an AI's decisions can be traced back to a specific set of rules, aligning with the principles of the **W3C Cognitive AI (CogAI)** group.

## The Rule Technologies

Webizen's architecture incorporates several rule standards, each with a specific purpose.

1.  **RIF (Rule Interchange Format):** A W3C standard designed to be a universal format for exchanging rules between different systems. Webizen uses RIF as the primary "lingua franca" for expressing complex, portable business logic, especially in agreements.

2.  **SWRL (Semantic Web Rule Language):** A language that combines OWL (Web Ontology Language) with a form of RuleML. SWRL is powerful for writing rules that operate on the rich vocabulary defined in Webizen's ontologies. It allows for more expressive conditions than simple if-then statements.

3.  **N3Logic (Notation3 Logic):** An expressive, human-readable language for RDF that includes a powerful formula-based syntax for expressing logic and rules directly within the graph. In Webizen, N3.js provides the tooling to parse and potentially execute N3Logic, making it ideal for embedding logic directly within data and for powering the reasoning capabilities of AI agents.

### A Practical Example: Enforcing an Agreement

Consider a `Hypermedia Content Package` that contains a musical album. The package includes an **ODRL** policy stating:

> "A user who has paid 10 XEC (the `odrl:pay` action) is granted permission to `odrl:play` the album."

While ODRL states the policy, a rule is needed to enforce it. A rule written in a RIF or SWRL-compatible format might look like this:

**IF:**
-   `?user` has a verified `ex:paymentReceipt` for `10 XEC` to `?album`.
-   `?album` has an `odrl:policy` granting `odrl:play` permission upon payment.
**THEN:**
-   Assert a new triple: `?user` `ex:hasPlaybackPermissionFor` `?album`.

The Webizen media player module would then query for the `ex:hasPlaybackPermissionFor` triple before allowing the user to play the album. This entire process—from policy definition to logical inference to enforcement—is automated by the rule engine, creating a robust and decentralized digital rights management system.

By integrating these powerful rule-based technologies, Webizen moves closer to its goal of being not just a data storage platform, but an intelligent, autonomous environment for its users.
