# Technology Stack

Webizen is built upon a carefully selected stack of modern, open, and decentralized technologies. Our choices are guided by a commitment to user sovereignty, data privacy, long-term security, and interoperability. This document provides an overview of the key technologies used across the Webizen ecosystem.

## Core Philosophies

Our technology choices reflect our core principles:

- **Decentralization First:** We prioritize peer-to-peer and federated technologies over centralized ones.
- **User Control:** Users must own and control their data and identity.
- **Interoperability:** We build on open W3C standards to ensure Webizen can interact with the broader decentralized web.
- **Security & Privacy by Design:** We integrate strong, modern cryptography and privacy-preserving techniques at every layer of the stack.

### Frontend & UI

The user interface is built with modern web technologies to ensure a responsive and accessible experience.

- **React:** A declarative, component-based JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It provides the foundation for all UI components in Webizen.
- **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework that allows for rapid UI development without leaving the HTML.
- **Monaco Editor:** The code editor that powers VS Code, integrated into our Editor Module for a rich, full-featured coding experience.
- **D3.js & MapLibre GL JS:** Used for data visualization, including Gantt charts for project management and spatio-temporal map visualizations.

### Application Platforms

Webizen is designed to be a cross-platform ecosystem.

- **Electron:** The foundation of our **Desktop Application**, allowing us to build a feature-rich app with web technologies that has deep access to the local system for running servers and managing data.
- **React Native:** Used to build the **Mobile App**, enabling code sharing with the desktop and web platforms while providing a native experience on Android and iOS.
- **WebExtensions API:** Powers the **Web Extension**, allowing Webizen to integrate directly with the user's existing browser (Chrome, Firefox).

### P2P & Decentralization

Peer-to-peer technologies are the heart of Webizen, eliminating reliance on central servers.

- **IPFS (InterPlanetary File System):** Used for content-addressed storage of all files and data objects, including Hypermedia Content Packages. This ensures data is resilient, censorship-resistant, and verifiable.
- **WebTorrent:** Provides a powerful solution for peer-to-peer sharing of large media files directly in the browser and desktop app.
- **GUN.eco:** A decentralized, real-time database used for features requiring low-latency synchronization, such as collaborative editing.
- **Tailscale (WireGuard):** Used to create a secure, zero-configuration virtual private network (VPN) between a user's devices (e.g., desktop and mobile), ensuring secure remote access to the Webizen API without exposing it to the public internet.

### Identity & Data

Webizen is built on a foundation of semantic, interoperable, and user-owned data.

- **Solid:** The core of our identity and data storage model. Users have their own **Solid Pod** (a personal data store), and their identity is managed via **WebID**, a decentralized and self-sovereign identity standard.
- **RDF (Resource Description Framework):** The foundational data model for the entire platform. All data, from user profiles to application configurations, is represented as RDF, enabling a rich, interconnected graph of knowledge.
- **N3.js, Quadstore, and Comunica:** The core libraries for working with RDF data. N3.js is used for parsing and serializing, Quadstore provides a local, high-performance RDF database, and Comunica is the query engine for executing SPARQL queries.
- **SHACL, RIF, SWRL, ODRL:** A suite of W3C standards used for data validation (SHACL), rule-based logic (RIF/SWRL), and defining access rights and policies (ODRL).

### Security & Cryptography

Our security model is multi-layered and designed for long-term, post-quantum resilience.

- **WebAuthn:** The primary standard for secure, passwordless authentication, allowing users to sign in with hardware keys or biometrics.
- **SPHINCS+:** A post-quantum digital signature algorithm used to secure high-value data like agreements and backups.
- **ECDSA (on secp256k1):** Used for all blockchain-related operations to ensure compatibility with the eCash network.
- **EdDSA (Ed25519):** A high-performance signature algorithm used for securing transient data and internal API communications.
- **TLS 1.3 & WebID-TLS:** All network communication is secured with TLS 1.3. WebID-TLS is used to bind a user's cryptographic identity directly to the secure transport layer.

### AI & Machine Learning

Webizen integrates AI as a tool to enhance user capabilities, not to control them.

- **Ollama & Local LLMs:** Provides support for running large language models locally, ensuring privacy and offline capability.
- **Chatterbox TTS:** A high-quality, open-source Text-to-Speech engine with emotional control, used for accessibility and hypermedia creation.
- **ChromaDB:** A vector database used for storing embeddings for semantic search and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) in our AI modules.
- **CogAI Principles:** Our AI development is guided by the W3C Cognitive AI Community Group, emphasizing transparency and human-centric reasoning.
