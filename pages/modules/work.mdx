# Module: Work Management

**The Work Management module is a comprehensive suite of tools for project management, designed for decentralized, collaborative teams. It includes features for managing projects, tasks, contributors, and assets, with integrated peer review and fair-terms contribution mechanisms.**

This module aims to be a complete project management solution that operates within the user's sovereign data pod, fostering transparent and equitable collaboration.

## Purpose and Functionality

The primary goal of the `work` module is to provide a powerful, self-hosted alternative to centralized project management tools like Jira or Trello.

**Core Functions:**
-   **Project Hierarchy:** Supports a nested structure of projects, sub-projects, and tasks.
-   **Contributor & Role Management:** Allows for assigning contributors to projects and tasks with specific roles (e.g., `manager`, `developer`, `tester`).
-   **Asset Tracking:** Enables linking tasks to specific digital assets, such as code commits (via `gitmark`), design documents, or media files stored on IPFS.
-   **Visualizations:** Provides multiple ways to visualize project progress:
    -   **Kanban Boards:** For agile task management.
    -   **Gantt Charts:** For timeline and dependency planning.
-   **Timesheets & Reporting:** Includes tools for contributors to log time against tasks and for managers to generate project status reports.
-   **Peer Review System:** A built-in system for peer-reviewing completed tasks or contributions, with the reviews stored as verifiable RDF data.
-   **Fair-Terms Contributions:** Integrates with the `agreements` module to attach fair-term contribution agreements to projects, ensuring clarity on licensing and compensation.

## Technical Implementation

-   **Module Path**: `src/modules/work/index.js`
-   **UI Component**: The complex user interface for work management is rendered by `src/components/Work.js`, which includes the Kanban and Gantt chart visualizations.
-   **Core Libraries**:
    -   `D3.js`: Used for rendering the Gantt chart and other data visualizations.
-   **Ontologies**:
    -   `ontologies/work-v1.ttl`: Defines the core schema for projects, tasks, contributors, and timesheets.
    -   `ontologies/work-v1.shacl.ttl`: Provides SHACL shapes to validate the integrity of project data.
-   **Dependencies**:
    -   `modules/agreements`: To attach contribution agreements to projects.
    -   `modules/cashtab`: For linking tasks to bounties or payments.
    -   `modules/timeline`: To provide data for the Gantt chart visualization.
    -   `modules/i18n`: To provide multilingual templates for project types and task descriptions.
    -   `services/solidos`: All work management data is persisted to the user's Solid Pod.

### Example Flow: Completing a Task with a Peer Review

1.  A developer, Alice, finishes a task. In the `Work.js` UI, she drags the task card from "In Progress" to the "In Review" column on the Kanban board.
2.  The UI dispatches an event: `eventBus.emit('work:update_task_status', { taskId: '...', newStatus: 'in_review' })`.
3.  The `work` module updates the task's status in the Quadstore and Solid Pod.
4.  The module's logic, based on the project's rules, assigns a peer, Bob, to review the task. It creates a new `work:ReviewRequest` and sends a notification to Bob.
5.  Bob reviews the work associated with the task (e.g., by viewing a linked "gitmark"). He approves the work in his UI.
6.  Bob's client dispatches an event: `eventBus.emit('work:submit_review', { taskId: '...', reviewData: { status: 'approved', comment: '...' } })`.
7.  The `work` module receives the review, saves it as RDF, and updates the original task's status to `completed`.
8.  If the task had an associated eCash bounty, this status change could automatically trigger a call to the `cashtab` module to release the payment to Alice.
