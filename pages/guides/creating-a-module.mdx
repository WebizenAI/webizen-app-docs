# Guide: Creating a Webizen Module
This guide will walk you through the process of creating a new module for Webizen. Modules are the primary way to extend the platform with new features and functionality. By the end of this tutorial, you will have built a simple "Greeter" module that displays a message and interacts with the rest of the system via the event bus.

---
## Prerequisites

Before you start, you should have a working local development environment. If you haven't set one up yet, please follow the **[Installation Guide](../getting-started/installation)**.
You should also be familiar with the core concepts of:

- [Webizen Architecture](../core-concepts/architecture)
- [Modular System](../core-concepts/modules)
---

## Step 1: Scaffold the Module Directory

First, create a new directory for your module inside the `src/modules/` directory. For this tutorial, we'll call it `greeter`.
```bash
mkdir src/modules/greeter
```
Inside this new directory, create the following files:

- `index.js`: This will contain the core logic of your module.
- `component.js`: This will be the main React component for your module's UI.
- `ontology.ttl`: An RDF file to define the data model for your module.
Your file structure should look like this:

```text
src/
└── modules/
    └── greeter/
```
