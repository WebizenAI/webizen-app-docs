# Hypermedia Content Packages

A core innovation in Webizen is the concept of a **Hypermedia Content Package**. This is a standardized, self-contained, and secure format for bundling diverse digital assets into a single, shareable unit. It allows creators to package not just a single file, but a complete, context-rich experience.

## The Concept

Imagine a research paper that is more than just a PDF. With a Hypermedia Content Package, it can include the original dataset, the software used for analysis, interactive visualizations, video presentations, and the legal license governing its use—all in one file.

This approach transforms static documents into dynamic, multi-layered experiences.

### Structure of a Package

A Hypermedia Content Package is a compressed archive (typically a `.zip` or `.hdf5` file) that contains a well-defined set of assets:

    subgraph "Hypermedia Content Package (e.g., my_research.zip)"
        A[manifest.rdf]
        subgraph "Assets"
            B[Linear Media (video.mp4, audio.mp3)]
            C[Non-Linear Media (subtitles.vtt, document.html)]
            D[Data & Code (dataset.csv, analysis.py)]
            E[Semantic Data (ontology.ttl, agreement.rdf)]
            F[Applications (viewer_app.js)]
        end
        subgraph "Policies & Credentials"
            G[Access Policy (policy.odrl)]
            H[Authorship Credential (author.vc.jsonld)]
        end
    end

- **`manifest.rdf` (Required):** The heart of the package. This RDF file acts as the table of contents, describing every other asset in the package, its format, its purpose, and the relationships between them. It provides the essential metadata that allows Webizen to understand and correctly render the package.

- **Linear Assets:** Time-based media like audio and video files.

- **Non-Linear Assets:** Content without a time dimension, such as HTML documents, PDF files, images, or subtitle tracks.

- **Data & Code:** The raw materials of the content, such as datasets, scripts, or software libraries.

- **Semantic Data:** Ontologies, SHACL shapes, and RDF-based agreements that provide rich context and rules for the content.

- **Applications:** Lightweight, sandboxed JavaScript applications that can act as custom viewers or interactive components for the package's content.

- **Policies & Credentials:**
    - **ODRL Policies:** An Open Digital Rights Language file defining the permissions and rules for using the content (e.g., who can view it, whether it can be copied, if payment is required).
    - **Verifiable Credentials:** Cryptographically signed credentials that prove authorship, authenticity, or other claims about the content.

### Security and Sharing

Security is built into the lifecycle of every Hypermedia Content Package.

1.  **Creation:** A user bundles the assets into a package.
2.  **Signing:** The entire package is hashed, and the hash is signed using the creator's **SPHINCS+** key. This signature guarantees the integrity and authenticity of the package, proving who created it and that it has not been tampered with.
3.  **Encryption (Optional):** For private content, the entire package can be encrypted using **AES**. The decryption key is not stored with the package but is shared with authorized users through a separate, secure channel (e.g., after an eCash payment is confirmed).
4.  **Sharing:** The signed (and optionally encrypted) package is stored on **IPFS**. The resulting IPFS CID is then shared with others. When another Webizen user receives the CID, they can download the package, verify its signature, and—if they have the key—decrypt and access its contents according to the ODRL policy within.

This powerful combination of bundling, semantic description, and strong cryptography makes Hypermedia Content Packages a cornerstone of secure, context-rich data sharing in the Webizen ecosystem.
