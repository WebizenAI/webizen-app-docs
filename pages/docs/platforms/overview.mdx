# Platform Overview

Webizen is not a single application but a cohesive ecosystem that spans multiple platforms. This multi-platform architecture is designed to provide users with a seamless experience, whether they are at their desk or on the go.

The ecosystem consists of three primary components, each with a distinct role and set of capabilities:

1.  **[Web Extension](./web-extension)**: Your lightweight, everyday interface to the Webizen network, living directly within your browser.
2.  **[Desktop Application](./desktop-app)**: The powerful core of your personal Webizen environment, acting as a local server, P2P node, and secure data hub.
3.  **[Mobile App](./mobile-app)**: Your on-the-go companion, securely connecting to your Desktop App for access to your data and social features.

## The Synergistic Relationship

These three components are designed to work together seamlessly. The Web Extension provides convenience, the Desktop App provides power and sovereignty, and the Mobile App provides portability.

-   The **Web Extension** relies on the **Desktop App** for its connection to the P2P network and for access to the user's full data pod.
-   The **Mobile App** securely connects to the **Desktop App** via a private network tunnel (Tailscale), ensuring that your data never has to be stored on a third-party cloud server to be accessible on your phone.

This architecture ensures that the user's data remains under their control, primarily on their own hardware, while still being accessible from anywhere. The following sections provide a more detailed look at the specific architecture and capabilities of each platform.
