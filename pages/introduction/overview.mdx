# Overview of Webizen

**Webizen is a humanitarian-focused, open-source initiative to build a decentralized, human-centric web. It is both a proof-of-concept and a reference platform designed to empower individuals with true data ownership, privacy, and control over their digital lives.**

At its core, Webizen is not just a tool, but a new paradigm for interacting with the web. It shifts the center of gravity from centralized platforms to the individual, creating an ecosystem where users are participants, not products.

## The Problem: A Centralized Web

The modern web, for all its benefits, has become increasingly centralized. A few large corporations control the platforms where we communicate, work, and share. This has led to significant challenges:

- **Data Exploitation:** User data is routinely harvested, monetized, and used in ways that are not transparent or beneficial to the user.
- **Censorship and Control:** Centralized platforms act as gatekeepers, with the power to censor content and de-platform users, often without due process.
- **Lack of Interoperability:** Data is locked into proprietary silos, making it difficult for users to move their information between services or for new, innovative applications to emerge.
- **Erosion of Privacy:** Pervasive tracking and surveillance have become the norm, undermining the fundamental right to privacy.

## The Webizen Solution: A Human-Centric Web

Webizen addresses these challenges by re-imagining the web's architecture with the individual at its center. Our solution is built on three pillars:

### Data Sovereignty

With Webizen, your data lives in a personal, decentralized data store called a **Solid Pod**. This pod can be hosted anywhere you choose—on your local machine via the Webizen Desktop App, on a home server, or with a provider you trust. You, and only you, grant applications permission to access your data on a granular basis. This fundamentally changes the data ownership model from corporate control to individual sovereignty.

### Decentralized Identity

Your online identity is managed through **WebID**, a W3C standard that turns a simple URL into a powerful, secure, and universal identifier. Because you control the location of your WebID profile, your identity is not tied to any single platform. This enables true account portability and puts an end to platform lock-in. We enhance this with modern, phishing-resistant authentication methods like **WebAuthn** and WebID-TLS.

### Modular Extensibility

Webizen is not a monolithic application but a modular ecosystem. The platform's functionality is delivered through a series of independent **modules** that can be enabled, disabled, or even replaced by the user. This allows for a highly customizable experience and creates a fertile ground for developers to build and share new tools and applications within the Webizen network, fostering a vibrant and resilient community.

By combining these principles with a robust technical foundation based on open standards, Webizen aims to provide a practical and powerful alternative to the centralized web—one that is more private, more secure, and fundamentally more human.
