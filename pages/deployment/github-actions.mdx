# Deployment with GitHub Actions

To automate the deployment of the documentation site to GitHub Pages, we will use a GitHub Actions workflow. This workflow will automatically trigger whenever you push changes to the `main` branch of your `webizen-app-docs` repository.

## The Workflow File

1.  In your `webizen-app-docs` repository, create a new directory structure: `.github/workflows/`.
2.  Inside the `workflows` directory, create a new file named `deploy.yml`.
3.  Copy and paste the following YAML content into the `deploy.yml` file.

### `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`

```yaml
name: Deploy Webizen Docs to GitHub Pages

on:
  # Runs on pushes targeting the main branch
  push:
    branches: [main]

  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab
  workflow_dispatch:

# Sets permissions of the GITHUB_TOKEN to allow deployment to GitHub Pages
permissions:
  contents: read
  pages: write
  id-token: write

# Allow only one concurrent deployment, skipping runs queued between the run in-progress and latest queued.
# However, do NOT cancel in-progress runs as we want to allow these production deployments to complete.
concurrency:
  group: "pages"
  cancel-in-progress: false
