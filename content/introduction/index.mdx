## About Webizen

Webizen is built on a foundation of cutting-edge decentralized technologies, including:

* **SolidOS:** For decentralized identity (WebID) and personal data storage in Pods.
* **IPFS:** For content-addressed, peer-to-peer file storage and sharing.
* **eCash:** As a native, peer-to-peer electronic cash system for the digital age.
* **Post-Quantum Cryptography:** Utilizing SPHINCS+ and other advanced cryptographic primitives to ensure long-term data security.

The platform is designed to be modular and extensible, allowing developers to create and integrate new features as self-contained "modules." This approach fosters a vibrant ecosystem of community-driven development and innovation.
