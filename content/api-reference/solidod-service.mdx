# SolidOS Service API Reference

The SolidOS Service (`services/solidos.js`) provides a high-level interface for interacting with a user's Solid Pod. As the user's Pod is their authoritative source of truth, this service is fundamental for any module that needs to persist data in a sovereign and interoperable manner.

**Note:** This service runs exclusively in the privileged **background process**. Modules do not interact with it directly but make requests through the secure [Webizen Core API](./webizen-api), which then calls this service's functions.

## Core Design Principles

-   **Abstraction:** The service provides a simplified API over the powerful but complex `@inrupt/solid-client` libraries. This makes common operations like fetching and saving RDF data much more straightforward for module developers.
-   **Authentication Aware:** The service automatically handles the authenticated session with the user's Solid Pod. All requests made through this service are authenticated using the user's WebID credentials.
-   **Resource-Oriented:** The API is designed around the concept of "Resources" in Solid, which can be either RDF documents (Datasets) or binary files.

## Key Functions for RDF Data

These functions are used for creating, reading, updating, and deleting structured RDF data (e.g., profiles, contacts, agreements).

### `getDataset(resourceUrl)`

Fetches an RDF resource (a "Dataset") from a Solid Pod.

-   **Description**: Retrieves the RDF triples contained within a specific resource URL.
-   **Parameters**:
    -   `resourceUrl` (string): The full URL of the RDF resource to fetch (e.g., `https://alice.pod.example/profile/card`).
-   **Returns**: `Promise<Dataset>` - A Solid-Client [Dataset](https://docs.inrupt.com/developer-tools/javascript/client-libraries/reference/glossary/#term-SolidDataset) object, which is a collection of RDF Quads.

### `saveDatasetAt(resourceUrl, dataset)`

Saves or overwrites an RDF resource in a Solid Pod.

-   **Description**: Writes a Dataset to the specified URL. If the resource already exists, it will be overwritten. If it does not exist, it will be created.
-   **Parameters**:
    -   `resourceUrl` (string): The full URL where the resource should be saved.
    -   `dataset` (Dataset): The Solid-Client Dataset object to save.
-   **Returns**: `Promise<Dataset>` - The saved Dataset object as confirmed by the Pod.

### `deleteResource(resourceUrl)`

Deletes a resource (either an RDF file or a binary file) from a Solid Pod.

-   **Description**: Permanently removes the specified resource.
-   **Parameters**:
    -   `resourceUrl` (string): The URL of the resource to delete.
-   **Returns**: `Promise<void>`

## Key Functions for Containers and Files

These functions are used for managing collections of resources (Containers) and non-RDF files.

### `getContainedResourceUrls(containerUrl)`

Lists the URLs of all resources within a Solid Container.

-   **Description**: Fetches the contents of a directory-like Container in a Solid Pod.
-   **Parameters**:
    -   `containerUrl` (string): The URL of the Container (must end with a `/`).
-   **Returns**: `Promise<string[]>` - An array of URLs for all files and sub-containers within the specified container.

### `getFile(fileUrl)`

Fetches a non-RDF, binary file from a Solid Pod.

-   **Description**: Retrieves any kind of file, such as an image, video, or PDF.
-   **Parameters**:
    -   `fileUrl` (string): The URL of the file to fetch.
-   **Returns**: `Promise<Blob>` - A Blob object containing the file's binary data and content type.

### `overwriteFile(fileUrl, fileBlob)`

Uploads or overwrites a binary file in a Solid Pod.

-   **Description**: Writes a file to the specified URL. This is used for storing assets like profile pictures or attachments.
-   **Parameters**:
    -   `fileUrl` (string): The full URL where the file should be saved.
    -   `fileBlob` (Blob): The file content as a Blob object.
-   **Returns**: `Promise<void>`
