# Webizen Architecture

The Webizen platform is designed with a robust, multi-process architecture to ensure security, stability, and performance. This model separates privileged operations from the user interface and sandboxes third-party applications, creating a secure environment for a decentralized operating system.

At a high level, the architecture is divided into three main layers: the **Background Process**, the **Foreground (UI) Process**, and the **Userland (Application) Layer**.

### Architectural Diagram

The following diagram illustrates the relationship between these core components and their interaction with external services.

### Layers Explained

#### 1. Background Process (`bg`)

The background process is the heart of the Webizen Desktop Application. It runs as a privileged Node.js process, giving it access to the user's file system and the ability to make network requests.

- **Responsibilities**:
    - Managing the local Solid Pod and Quadstore database.
    - Handling all P2P networking (IPFS, WebTorrent, GUN.eco).
    - Executing all cryptographic operations (signing, encryption).
    - Running the local HTTPS server and exposing the **Webizen API** over secure WebSockets.
    - Interacting with external services like the eCash network.
- **Security**: This process is the only part of the application with direct access to sensitive user keys and system resources. All interactions with it are mediated through a strict API.

#### 2. Foreground (UI) Process (`fg`)

This is the main window of the Webizen Desktop Application that the user interacts with. It's an Electron-based Chromium window.

- **Responsibilities**:
    - Rendering the main user interface, including the sidebar, settings, and core application views.
    - Communicating with the background process via the secure internal RPC API to request data and trigger actions.
    - Managing and displaying userland applications within sandboxed `<webview>` tags.
- **Security**: The foreground process has no direct access to the file system or sensitive keys. It operates as a standard web page, with its capabilities restricted to what the background process exposes through the API.

#### 3. Userland (Application) Layer

This layer consists of all applications that run within the Webizen environment.

- **Local Apps**: These are Solid or Webizen-specific applications hosted by the local server in the Desktop App and rendered in sandboxed `<webview>` tags. They interact with the user's data exclusively through the `window.webizen` API provided by the background process, which enforces permissions.
- **Web Extension**: The browser extension provides a subset of Webizen's functionality. It communicates with the Desktop App's background process to access the user's data and the P2P network, acting as a remote client to the user's own local server.

This layered architecture ensures that even if a userland application or the UI process is compromised, the core user data and keys managed by the background process remain secure.
